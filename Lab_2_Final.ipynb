I chose to put the total win points on the Y axis which displays total win points, and then on the X axis I chose to put the year of the game data which is scaled by every other year.

I started off by comparing two random mascots the \"Alligator\" mascot and the \"Lion\" mascot. Once again, I chose to put the win points on the Y axis and the two random mascots on the X axis.

An area chart is supposed to be used with care, they are good at showing changes to total, but seeing change in components can be very difficult. Out of the 7 graphs that I created this area chart was by far the worst. I had trouble finding variables to show the change over time, the poor idea that I did was the total change over time of total points scored by all the teams combined. On the Y axis is total points and then on the X axis is the year of game data, although it doesn't do a good job of showing the change over time of total points scored it still shows that data just not in a very visually appealing way."

A paired column chart is as per standard column but allows for multiple series, and it can become tricky to read with more than two series. After I brainstormed which variables would be good to compare on a paired column chart, I plotted them and used the measures of total win points and total lose points. On the X axis it is dual axis with both win points and lose points side by side for an easy comparison between the two. After they were side by side for any easy comparison, I changed the colors, so they were completely different colors and easily able to be differentiated between the two from a glance."

For the example that I did, I chose to use the variable \"winning tax class\" and throw that on a pie chart sorted by the top 10 based on total win points. After all that information was on the pie chart, I added the names of the winning tax class and then after that was added I also threw on the percentages.
